*Q. How do I get an overview of how this Google Maps Server-side clustering works?*

A. Read my blog http://kunuk.wordpress.com/2011/11/05/google-map-server-side-clustering-with-asp-net/

---------------------------------

*Q. What do I need to run this?*

A. Visual Studio 2010 or later, .Net v4.
For deployment the web.config is configured for IIS 7 or later.

---------------------------------

*Q. Where is the latest version?*

A. The latest version is in the SVN repository, the trunk.
If you want the latest version you should do SVN checkout.

---------------------------------

*Q. How many points can I use?*

A. With current implementation, the upper limit should be around 300.000 where the delay is below 1 sec. 
The server running time with an average laptop was about 300 msec. for 300.000 points. 

It should be possible to increase the number of points and keep a delay below 1 sec. 
by implementing a spatial data structure such as range search but it would only help if you are zoomed in. 
If you are zoomed all the way out you will have to iterate all the points  
then you would have to rely on pre-clustering for time complexity improvement.

---------------------------------

*Q. How do I control the grid size?*

A. In the file mapclustering.js
specific values are set for gridx and gridy in the settings.

---------------------------------

*Q. How do I load the dataset?*

A. By default the dataset are loaded from a csv file to the Application session.
Look how it is done in {{{Kunukn.GooglemapsClustering.WebGoogleMapClustering.Application_Start}}}

The csv file is located at 
{{{GoogleMapsClustering/WebGoogleMapsClustering/AreaGMC/Files/Points.csv}}}

The format of the csv file is 
longitude; latitude; point id in GUID format; type id.

The point id and type id data in this example are dummy data.
Only the longitude and latitude are parsed to double values.
point id and type id are string values and are not parsed.

There is also the possible to load from a serialized file programmatically but no example file is included.
Look in the code {{{Kunukn.GooglemapsClustering.DataUtility.Dataset.LoadDatasetFromDatabase()}}}

---------------------------------

*Q. How do I set the initial zoom-level and position?*

A. In the file mapclustering.js
those values are set in the settings area.

---------------------------------

*Q. When does the clustering stops?*

A. You can define at which zoom-level the clustering should stop. 
In the file mapclustering.js in the settings set a value for zoomlevelClusterStop.

---------------------------------

*Q. What are the red grid lines used for?*

A. I made them for debugging purpose, i.e. to make sure the clustering behaved as intented. 
By default there can only be either one mark inside a grid. Either a cluster-point or a single point.

---------------------------------

*Q. How do I enable/disable the red gridlines?*

A. In the file {{{mapclustering.js }}}
set the showGridLines to false or disable it server-side
setting {{{Kunukn.GooglemapsClustering.Clustering.Config.DoShowGridLinesInGoogleMap}}} to false. 
I recommend to disable it server-side which will reduce the json-data size for the webservice call.

---------------------------------

*Q. How do I extend the viewport data send to the client?*

A. Increase or decrease the value in 
{{{Kunukn.GooglemapsClustering.Clustering.Config.OuterGridExtend}}}

---------------------------------

*Q. How do I control the cluster merging point?*

A. Increase or decrease the value in 
{{{Kunukn.GooglemapsClustering.Clustering.Config.MergeWithin}}}

---------------------------------

*Q. How do I set the minimum count of points level before a cluster is made?*

A. Increase or decrease the value in 
{{{Kunukn.GooglemapsClustering.Clustering.Config.MinClusterSize}}}

---------------------------------

*Q. Why do the red gridlines look wierd when zoomed far out?*

A. The data for drawing the gridlines are assumed correct last time I checked. The Google API 
for drawing red linens can't draw all longitude value scenarious (I Assume), 
e.g. from 60 to -100. I didn't want to spend more time on the value scenarious to make a fix 
by splitting draw functions to something like e.g. 60 to 180 and then -180 to -100

---------------------------------

*Q. Is the clustering broken if I change the window size?*

A. The clustering might behave buggy if you increase the window size. 
A quick fix is to edit the property {{{Kunukn.GooglemapsClustering.Data.ClusterInfo.IsFilterData}}}
increase to higher value e.g. {{{ZoomLevel>=7}}}. This property is also used for filtering data returned to client. 
if set to never filter, then too much data will be send back to the client when zoomed far in.

---------------------------------

*Q. How did you get the idea for the clustering part?*

A. Inspiration from 
http://www.crunchpanorama.com/ and 
http://code.google.com/intl/da-DK/apis/maps/articles/toomanymarkers.html

---------------------------------

*Q. How do I generate random data points?*

A. Use the method: {{{Kunukn.GooglemapsClustering.TestConsole.Program.GenerateRandomDatasetToCSVFile()}}}
to update information for how many points you want and in which area you want them.

---------------------------------

*Q. Who made the Google Maps search function in this example?*

A. The example code is with inspiration from
http://tech.cibul.net/geocode-with-google-maps-api-v3/

---------------------------------

*Q. What is the complexity of time and space?*

A. Time complexity is on average(m*n) and space complexity is O(m*n)
where n is the number of points used in total and m is the number of grids returned to the client. 
You are welcome to analyse it yourself :) I use hashset and hashmap to minimize the time complexity.

Time complexity is ~ O(n^2) on worst case but extremely unlikely, 
happens if most centroids are merged with neighbor-centroids.
---------------------------------

*Q. Where did you get the points?*

A. The points are taken from the file cities5000 at http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/

---------------------------------

*Q. How can I customize this to use most points and keep fast performance?*

A. 
In the file: {{{Kunukn.GooglemapsClustering.Clustering.Config}}}. 
Set {{{OuterGridExtend}}} to 0. 
Set {{{DoMergeGridIfCentroidsAreCloseToEachOther}}} to false. 
Set {{{DoShowGridLinesInGoogleMap}}} to false. 


In the mapclustering.js in the settings. 
set gridx and gridy to low numbers, e.g. 2 and 2.
---------------------------------

*Q. Who made this?*

A. Kunuk Nykjaer spend the time in the weekends to make 
a stationary grid-based clustering after preliminary research on different clustering approach. 
On my time on the job I made a marker-clusterer version 
which I later discontinued because I felt the grid-based worked better. 
All the server-side clustering logic is made by Kunuk Nykjaer.
The JS GUI-part is largely adapted and reworked by Kunuk Nykjaer and the inspiration came partly 
from JS-implementation by Jonas Olsen, Lars Gundersen and misc. http://stackoverflow.com/ pages. 
The server-side webservice definition are with inspiration from Lasse Rasch's implementations.
The JS logic-part (cluster points updating, lines drawing) was made by Kunuk Nykjaer).
The address search part done with inspiration 
from http://tech.cibul.net/geocode-with-google-maps-api-v3/.
The cluster images are taken from Google's example images.
The marker images are taken from http://mapicons.nicolasmollet.com/
